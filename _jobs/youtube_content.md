We are looking for a contractor to perform short term YouTube channel management for one of our TV network clients for 12 weeks, starting immediately. The work would take about 20 hours a week and would entail:

- Programming & scheduling content for the channel
- Preparing all uploads for publishing including video copy, metadata, & annotations
- Creating & managing channel playlists
- Maintaining community through interacting with & responding to fan comments and videos
- Monitoring discussions for key brands/titles/talent, including fan uploads
- Tracking new creative endeavors & gathering content internally at The Network
- Reviewing YouTube analytics/statistics for internal reports
- Collecting stories about brand resonance and content performance for internal reports
- Developing key content and messaging in conjunction with the Social Media team for distribution and amplification
- Joining and participating in internal Network meetings to provide updates and stay on top of content development

The ideal candidate has experience managing and maintaining an active YouTube channel. YouTube Certification is a plus but not necessary.  Though this engagement is short-term, there is potential for recurring work or longer-term engagements for the right fit.

As the work entails working closely with staff at EA1’s office in the Lower East Side and the client’s office in midtown Manhattan, applicants must reside in New York City.

Interested? Send us a resumé and a link to any active YouTube channels you manage (or have managed) here.
