Everybody at Once is seeking a paid (yep, we said paid!) Marketing and Communications Intern to work with some of the best media and entertainment brands in the industry. The ideal candidate is an enthusiastic and well organized go getter with 2 - 3 years of college experience or beyond, who is majoring in marketing, communications, journalism, digital media, and/or social media.

You should be an incredibly strong writer and analytic thinker. You notice the unnoticed and can make a story out of whatever information is at hand. You can strategize years in advance, and recognize how the decisions you make today will impact the future. You love explaining what others might not see in a simple way, and you live for positive feedback but don’t worry about making mistakes. You also enjoy all types of media, whether it’s that weird cat video your friend sent, Netflix, indie films, or Youtube.

The position is based in New York City, and will require you to come our our office or our clients’ office at least twice a week for a minimum of 10 - 12 hours.
