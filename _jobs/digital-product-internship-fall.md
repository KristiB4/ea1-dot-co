Everybody at Once is a consultancy based in NYC that specializes in audience development and social strategy for media, entertainment, and sports.

Everybody at Once (EA1) is a small, growing, fun, company founded in 2013, renowned for strategic audience development and social media strategy with the most interesting brands in media and entertainment. Our mission is to facilitate the connection between creators, their fans, and the communities that they inspire. We manage and support a wide range of fandom initiatives, including the Doctor Who Tumblr and #CloneClub for Orphan Black. We are currently a team of 11 full-time staff (plus a handful of collaborators) based in the Lower East Side. We are all passionate about fan communities, animated gifs, and poptarts.

We are seeking curious, hard working, excited, and efficient interns to join our team in New York for 3 months beginning the week of August 15, 2016 through the week of December 12th (dates are flexible.) You must be available for a minimum of 12 hours per week between the hours of 10 AM and 6 PM, with the possibility of some additional hours in the office or remotely. (Not to exceed 20 hours total per week.)

As an EA1 intern, your primary responsibility will be helping out our Brand Managers with everyday tasks that will teach you practical skills in content creation and social brand management.

Your responsibilities will include:

1. Assembling posts for Twitter/Tumblr/Facebook/Instagram/SnapChat/Vine, and other emerging social platforms.
2. Actively searching for fan community content and adding appropriate posts to brand queues.
3. Assisting with social campaigns such as giveaways, clearances for fan content, and events.
4. Creating images and GIFs for our brands.
5. Researching and sharing observations for other fan communities.
6. Participating in special projects, some administration, and perform other duties as assigned.

The best candidate will be:

1. An active participant in social media.
2. Knowledgeable about fan communities.
3. An actual fan of things!
4. A team player.
5. Excellent at internet research.
6. Very organized.
7. Experienced with community outreach.
8. Fluent in the Adobe CS Suite (Photoshop and/or Final Cut is a plus).
9. Excellent at written and verbal communication skills.
